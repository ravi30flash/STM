# IPTABLES

[iptable](https://linux.die.net/man/8/iptables) is a utility used to make changes in linux firewall

## netfilter 

[netfilter](https://www.netfilter.org/) is a framework provided by linux kernel which allows various networking related operations to be implemented in the form of rules.

# Squid Proxy server
[Squid Proxy server](http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/) it a cache and HTTP web proxy which allow client machines to find servers over internet without exposing their internal ip address.

# Pfsense
[pfSense](https://www.pfsense.org/) is a firewall/router computer software distribution based on FreeBSD. The open source pfSense Community Edition (CE) and pfSense Plus is installed on a physical computer or a virtual machine to make a dedicated firewall/router for a network.


# Reverse Proxy
[Reverse Proxy](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/reverse-proxy-server/)  A reverse proxy server is a type of proxy server that typically sits behind the firewall in a private network and directs client requests to the appropriate backend server. A reverse proxy provides an additional level of abstraction and control to ensure the smooth flow of network traffic between clients and servers.


# Load Balancer
[Load Balancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)) is a process of distributing load of a server on multiple server, but their
internal ip is not accessible to the user. nginx is the server used to do 
load balancing.
